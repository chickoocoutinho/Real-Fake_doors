                    Software engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product.

                    Software project management has wider scope than software engineering process as it involves communication, pre and post delivery support etc.
                    
                    This tutorial should provide you basic understanding of software product, software design and development process, software project management and design complexities etc. At the end of the tutorial you should be equipped with well understanding of software engineering concepts.
